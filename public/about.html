<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I'm a 20-year-old beginner web-developer, who is currently studying at Webster's university in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>I have a big dream of starting my own clothing brand that makes luxury fancy tops (i.e. hoodies, t-shirts, longsleeves, ...), and this IT part of my journey is one of the many more yet to come.</p>

<p>Also, I'd like to have a dedicated Ariana Grande part on my website, so there it is.</p>
